class Object

public boolean equals(Object rhs)

class X {

public boolean (The same) equals (X) Object rhs

X x_1 x_2

if(x1.equals(x2)

Watch out when using equals it might not have been overwritten

instead if(x1.theSame(x2)




Wrapper classes
contain 1 value of a primitive type
Primitive types: Integer, Double, Character

All primitive types have different methods

If using a primitive types as if it were an Object. When concatenating java will automaticly put it in a wrapper class.
This is call AUTO-BOXING
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html

In 1 we could catch any exception 

for 2 we have to capture the exceptions by type using

APException extends Exception {
	APException(String s){
		super(s)
	}
}
IN THE CODE

try {
}catch(APException e)){
}




Interfaces

a class defines a types just as primitive types.
Names of Interfaces start with a captial letter

interface F{
}

F f;
